# Install Kubernetes Cluster with Kubeadm on Ubuntu 22.04

Set up the system hostname and the /etc/hosts file on all the servers:

`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname cplane1`, same for worker nodes but with different name such as `worker1` and `worker2`

Modify the /etc/hosts with `sudo nano /etc/hosts` so that each hostname is pointed to the corrected IP address:
`192.168.5.10 cplane1
192.168.5.25 worker1
192.168.5.26 worker2`
